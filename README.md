# Star Notarization Dapp
### Simple decentralized application on the Ethereum Blockchain

This project is a simple dapp that allows users to notarize and own stars on the Ethereum blockchain.
By building this project, I intend to get a better understanding and appreciation for decentralised and distributed technologies.

Note: This project is built using truffle (specifically the truffle webpack box), thus it should be used to test and run the project.

##### Project Versions:
  - [V1](https://github.com/gerry101/Star-Notarization-Dapp): Simple dapp that allows one star to be owned by only one user.
    - The star can be claimed by another user.
    - The stars name can be changed.
    - UI written in simple HTML and vanilla JS.
