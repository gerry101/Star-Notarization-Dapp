This project is a simple dapp that allows users to notarize and own stars on the Ethereum blockchain.

Note: This project is built using truffle (specifically the truffle webpack box), thus it should be used to test and run the project.

##### Project Versions:
  - [V1](https://github.com/gerry101/Star-Notarization-Dapp/tree/development-V1): Simple dapp that allows one star to be owned by only one user.
    - The star can be claimed by another user.
    - The stars name can be changed.
    - UI written in simple HTML and vanilla JS.
  - [V2](https://github.com/gerry101/Star-Notarization-Dapp/tree/development-V2)
    - Implemented the ERC721 token standard in the dapp.
    - Multiple stars can be created and owned by multiple users in the dapp.
    - Owners of stars can put them up for sale at different prices they deem fit.
    - Other users can buy stars from the marketplace.
    - Improved the UI and UX of the dapp (still leveraging simple HTML and vanilla JS).
  - [V3](https://github.com/gerry101/Star-Notarization-Dapp/tree/development-V3)
    - Gave the star token a name(Nostary) and symbol(NST).
    - Implemented functionality to exchange star tokens between addresses.
    - Implemented functionality to transfer a star to another addresses.
    - Added functionality to look up star token information directly.
    - Added UI functionality to interact with some of the added contract functionality.
    - Deployed the contract to the public rinkeby test network ([view tx](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0x8248304affc7c93b692f347b952d0b513e64990d4044dbf238e96769a4bd2d65))
